Lab 4: Paint application

-------------
DESCRIPTION

This lab will create a tiny "Paint" application that will operate on our RISC-V computer emulator. This program will utilize keyboard input to make patterns on a Bitmap display. A bitmap "maps" a bit pattern to a particular color for display. When we pull that value over a display unit, the address where we keep this color value functions effectively as a "pixel." A beginning pixel coordinate will be specified by the user. Then, using the w, a, s, and d keys, youÂ may draw straight lines in the left and right directions. Directions are up and down. They may also draw diagonally by hitting the q, c, e, and z keys.
